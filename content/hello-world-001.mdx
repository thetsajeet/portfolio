# Welcome Internet Traveler! 🌍🚀

I’m **Ajeet**, or as the internet calls me — **theaj7** _(pronounced "the A-J-seven")_.
Welcome to my corner of the web — part blog, part lab, part chaotic genius energy ⚡.

- A thinker, tinkerer, and technologist.
- A hardcore software engineer who uses **neovim** - btw.
- A builder of quirky side projects that ships ( _mostly_ ) and always teaches.

## So... What’s This Place?

Think of this site as my digital playground. Here I share things I'm learning, building, and breaking — with code, caffeine, and curiosity.

Expect to find:

- ✨ Deep dives into tech I'm exploring
- 🔧 Projects I’m hacking together (some serious, some fun, all educational)
- 🧠 Thoughts on software engineering, system design, and building for scale
- 🤖 Experiments with AI, automation, and whatever the next shiny thing is

## A Bit About Me

I’m the kind of person who reads **Computer Network** textbooks _for fun_ and rewrites APIs just because it could be cleaner. My current stack of obsessions includes:

- FastAPI, Go, Node and anything that makes backends fast ⚙️
- MongoDB, Postgres, Neo4j and the eternal quest for the perfect schema 🧮
- Building platforms — from recommendation engines to gamified learning experiences
- Biased towards Next & its ecosystem for UI. But also experimenting Solid, Angular, and making UIs feel like a Studio Ghibli film 🧙‍♂️✨

## Why Blog?

Because sharing is caring. And because some of my Stack Overflow questions now answer _other people’s_ Stack Overflow questions 😎

Whether you're a fellow dev, a curious wanderer, or just here for the memes — thanks for stopping by. Follow along if you're into high-quality brain dumps, occasional hot takes, and stuff that makes you go _"Wait… that’s cool."_
